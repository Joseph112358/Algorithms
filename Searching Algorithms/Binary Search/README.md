Binary search is a searching algorithm which works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item you are looking for, until you've narrowed down the possible locations to just 1. 
- it has a time compelxity of O(log2 n) (or just log n)
- The only precondtion is that the array is already sorted.
